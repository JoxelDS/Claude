## BEFORE YOU SEND: RULES

1. **Personalize every message** - mention their brand name, a recent post, or something specific
2. **Send manually** - never use automation tools (account ban risk)
3. **Max 10-15 DMs per day** - spread across the day, not all at once
4. **Only message warm leads** - people who engaged with your content, visited your profile, or are in your niche
5. **Follow up once** - if no reply after 3-5 days, send ONE follow-up then move on
6. **Track everything** - use the tracking sheet below

## TEMPLATE 2: The Results Angle

Hey [Name],

Quick question — are you currently running paid ads or relying mainly on organic content for [their business]?

We recently helped a [similar industry] brand go from [X] to [Y result] in 60 days by restructuring their content strategy and ad targeting.

## TEMPLATE 3: The Observation Approach
**Best for:** Brands with good products but weak social media presence

```
Hey [Name],

I've been following [their brand] for a bit and I have to say — your [product/service] is solid.

One thing I noticed though: your social media presence doesn't match the quality of what you're offering. That's actually a huge opportunity.

We help brands close that gap between great product and great visibility. Social media management, content creation, paid ads — the full picture.

If you're open to it, I'd love to share a few ideas specific to [their brand]:
