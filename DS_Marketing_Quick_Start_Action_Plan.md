## WEEK 2: SCALE THE SYSTEM

Now that you've proven it works, batch everything:

**Monday Morning (2 hours):**
1. Generate 4 carousel scripts with AI (30 min)
2. Design all 4 in Canva (90 min)
3. Export all PDFs

**Monday Afternoon (30 min):**
1. Generate captions for all 4 (10 min with AI)
2. Schedule entire week on Instagram (10 min)
3. Schedule entire week on LinkedIn (10 min)

**Tuesday-Friday:**
- Just engage with comments
- Reply within first hour of posting
- Track what's working

---

## WHAT TO TRACK (Weekly)

**Create a simple spreadsheet:**

| Post Date | Topic | Reach | Engagement | Saves | Comments | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|-------|----------|-------|
| Mar 3 | Social Mistakes | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | - |

**After one week, analyze:**
- Which topic got most engagement?
- Which format worked best?
- What time performed best?
- Which hook stopped more scrolls?

**Adjust next week based on data.**

---

## COMMON FIRST-WEEK MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Overthinking the design**
→ Your first carousel won't be perfect. Ship it.

**Mistake 2: Waiting for "the perfect time" to post**
→ Just schedule it. Data will tell you optimal times.

**Mistake 3: Creating too much at once**
→ Start with 3-4 carousels. Master the system first.

**Mistake 4: Not engaging with comments**
→ Reply to EVERY comment in first hour. Algorithm loves this.

**Mistake 5: Changing templates constantly**
→ Stick to your templates. Consistency = brand recognition.

4. Always include logo on slide 1 or 10
5. Always number slides (2/10, 3/10...)
6. Always schedule Mon/Wed/Fri for IG
7. Always adapt and post Tue/Thu for LinkedIn
8. Always reply to comments within 1 hour

**These rules create your signature look.**

---

## WHEN YOU GET STUCK

**Issue: "I don't know what to post"**
→ Open: DS_Marketing_30_Day_Content_Strategy.md
→ Pick any topic from the calendar
→ Use the AI prompts to generate script

**Issue: "My design looks off"**
→ Open: DS_Marketing_Brand_Style_Guide.md
→ Check the design rules
→ Less is more - remove elements, don't add

**Issue: "I'm spending too much time"**
→ You're overthinking
→ Follow the templates exactly
→ Use AI for ALL copywriting
→ Batch create, don't do daily

**Issue: "My engagement is low"**
→ Reply to every comment (algorithm boost)
→ Check your hooks - are they bold enough?
→ Post at optimal times (11 AM for IG)
→ Give it 4 weeks before adjusting

---

## NEXT LEVEL (Month 2+)

**Once you've mastered the basics:**

1. **Add more templates** (black background variations, comparison layouts)
2. **Test different content angles** (hot takes, case studies, behind-scenes)
3. **Expand to more platforms** (Twitter threads, Pinterest)
4. **Repurpose top posts** (turn into blog posts, emails)
5. **Create content pillars** (consistent weekly themes)
6. **Build a content library** (save all your best hooks, scripts)
7. **A/B test hooks** (3 variations of slide 1, see which performs)

**But don't think about this yet. Master weeks 1-4 first.**
