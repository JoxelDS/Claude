YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA ISN'T FAILING. YOUR STRATEGY IS.

We've audited 200+ brands in the last year. These 7 mistakes showed up in 90% of them.

The worst part? Most businesses don't even realize they're making them. They blame the algorithm, the platform, the timing — everything except the actual problem.

The good news: every single one of these is fixable. And fixing them doesn't require a bigger budget. It requires a better approach.

Swipe through all 7. Be honest about which ones apply to you.

Then do something about it.
