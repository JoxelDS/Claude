After auditing 200+ brands across industries last year, a pattern became impossible to ignore.

The companies struggling with social media weren't failing because of the algorithm, their budget, or their industry. They were making the same 7 strategic mistakes — repeatedly.

The most common:

1. No content plan (random posts = random results)
2. Ignoring analytics entirely
3. Chasing vanity metrics over real engagement
4. Inconsistent brand voice across channels
5. Treating every platform identically
6. Zero post-publish engagement strategy
7. Posting without a distribution plan

The encouraging part: every single one of these is fixable without increasing your budget. It requires a shift in approach, not resources.

We break down each mistake and the fix in this carousel.

Which of these have you seen most often in your industry? Curious to hear your experience.

## THURSDAY - "The Perfect Social Media Content Calendar"
### Post Date: Thursday @ 10:00 AM | Platform: LinkedIn

```
Most marketing teams spend 20+ hours per week creating social media content with inconsistent results.

Our team spends 10 hours. For better results.

The difference isn't talent or tools. It's the system.

We use a weekly content framework that balances four pillars:
- Education (builds authority)
- Industry insight (builds relevance)
- Social proof (builds trust)
- Engagement (builds community)

The framework:

Monday — Educational content
Tuesday — Industry insights and trends
Wednesday — Case studies and results
Thursday — Behind-the-scenes process
Friday — Audience engagement
Weekend — Brand story and values

The key insight most teams miss: batch-create everything Monday morning. Then spend Tuesday through Friday purely on engagement and distribution.

Creation and distribution are two different jobs. Stop trying to do both simultaneously.

We break down each day's strategy in this carousel.

What does your current content workflow look like? I'd be interested to compare notes.
