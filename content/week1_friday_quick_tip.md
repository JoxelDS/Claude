Your audience decides in 3 seconds
whether to stop scrolling or keep going.

Not your logo. Not your color palette.
Not your perfectly curated feed.

Your first line. Your first slide.
That's where the battle is won or lost.

## INSTAGRAM CAPTION (Copy/Paste Ready)

```
3 seconds. That's all you get.

Every piece of content you create lives or dies in the first 3 seconds. Your audience is scrolling fast, distracted, and looking for a reason to stop.

Give them that reason.

Your hook should be bold, specific, and impossible to ignore. Not clever. Not cute. Bold.

Here's a simple test: read your first line out loud. If it doesn't make someone stop mid-scroll, rewrite it.

The best content in the world means nothing if nobody stops to read it.

Double tap if your hooks need work. Be honest.
